### 1. Project Overview

This project addresses the inefficiency of the "one-size-fits-all" marketing strategy prevalent in offline retail. By designing and implementing a **Store Profile System**, we leveraged machine learning and data analysis to enable **targeted offline marketing**.

As a core member of this project, I spearheaded the "Store-Specific Strategy" initiative, leading the end-to-end process from data processing and profile mining to strategy formulation and impact evaluation. Ultimately, the strategy I proposed successfully **increased store sales by approximately 24%** in pilot stores.

### 2. Business Problem & Goal

* **Problem**: The vast majority of offline marketing campaigns employ a "one-size-fits-all" approach. This method lacks precision, fails to effectively engage diverse customer subgroups, and consequently, does not maximize a campaign's potential uplift.

* **Goal**: Our objective was to pivot to **Targeted Marketing**. By creating detailed store profiles, we aimed to deploy customized marketing strategies tailored to unique customer segments, thereby achieving personalized uplift and maximizing overall business impact.

### 3. My Methodology & Process

To achieve this goal, I designed and implemented the **Store Profile Management System (SPMS)** with the following core workflow:

1.  **Framework Design**: I designed the SPMS with a three-module workflow: a **Central Database** for data consolidation and cleaning, a **Profile Label System** for tag generation, and a **Business Applications (Biz Apps)** module for marketing execution and analysis.

2.  **Profile Label Creation**: This is the core of the system. We constructed store profiles using a three-tiered labeling architecture:
    * **Statistical Labels**: Raw consumer data collected directly from resellers.
    * **Rule-based Labels**: Tags generated by applying business rules to the statistical labels.
    * **ML-mined Labels**: Deep, latent user-preference tags automatically discovered from vast datasets using machine learning algorithms (e.g., activity level, spending power, purchase potential).

3.  **Targeted Campaign Implementation**: We then applied these profiles to real-world marketing campaigns. For instance, in an Apple Watch promotion:
    * **Traditional Approach**: A single message ("Apple Watch, a new favorite in the fashion world") sent to all stores yielded a **+15%** total effect.
    * **My Targeted Approach**: By tailoring messages to different profiles (e.g., "Your health and sports partner" for health-focused customers), the total effect **increased to approximately +30%**.

4.  **Rigorous Impact Evaluation**: To rigorously measure the strategy's impact, I led the design of an end-to-end A/B testing process. My analysis incorporated advanced statistical methods such as **CUPED, Difference-in-Differences (DiD), and Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**. I also innovatively proposed the use of **Clustered Standard Errors** to address statistical biases arising from discrepancies between randomization and analysis units, ensuring the robustness of our conclusions.

### 5. My Contribution

* **Strategy & Initiative Leadership**: I conceptualized and spearheaded the "Store-Specific Strategy" from its inception, earning strong buy-in from business stakeholders.
* **System Architecture**: I independently designed the core workflow of the SPMS and its three-tiered labeling system, which laid the foundational framework for the project's success.
* **Technical Execution & Innovation**: I applied machine learning algorithms for core profile mining and used advanced causal inference methods to scientifically validate the project's impact, solving key statistical challenges in the evaluation process.

### 6. Results & Impact

* **Key Result**: The "Store-Specific Strategy" I led resulted in an **average sales increase of approximately 24%** across all pilot stores over a three-month period.
* **Business Impact**: This project proved the immense value of data-driven targeted marketing in an offline retail context. It provided the entire channel sales organization with a scalable, reusable framework for analysis and optimization, achieving the goals of high precision and near-optimal overall effectiveness.
